# Features

**1. Crop Yield Prediction Model (IT21308352|	Jayathilaka D.H.R.A)**

Predicts potential yield based on weather, water availability, and soil conditions.
 
**2. Paddy Variety Prediction Model (IT21227868|	Piyumani K.V.P	)**

Identifies the most suitable rice varieties for specific regions based on user-input districts, leveraging local climate and soil data.

**3. Pre Harvesting Disease Detection & Treatment Suggestion Model (IT21225192 |	Amarasinghe A.I.S.A)**

Utilizes image processing to detect diseases in paddy fields, providing actionable prevention and treatment strategies.

**4. Weed Detection and Management Model (IT21227318 | Jayasekara S.S.D)**

Employs image processing to identify weed varieties in paddy fields and offers strategies for their management.
